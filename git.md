# tabs in `version control view`
- Local Changes
  show the output like that of `git status`
- Log

# icons in `version control view`
- commit(tick)
- revert(discard local changes)
- diff(performs `git diff`; remember to choose a file to activate this icon)

# icons in the git section of the toolbar
- clock
the clock icon is particularly useful. after selecting a file in the project view, click the clock icon to 
show the **file history**. clicking a file doesn't automatically refresh the **file history**. an extra click
on the clock icon is necessary to refresh it.
